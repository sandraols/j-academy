          Ok, so I want to participate in the J-academy very much. Let’s just
          make that clear.<br /><br />And why do I want that? <br /><br />First
          of all Jayway seems like a really nice company, I like your values and
          I’d love to participate during the project. It seems like you have a
          very nice vibe going on, and the office in Malmö looks divine.<br /><br />Second
          of all it has been hard for me to find that first-time-job within web
          development, mainly because I lack work experience. I have even tried
          to find an internship, but unless I’m linked to an education few
          companys will take me. I’m kind of caught in the middle here.
          <br /><br />
          I truly need that career kickstart that is mentioned in the
          description. <br /><br />
          Third; I would really benefit from everything J-academy provides.
          Working in a team with a real project, learning agile development
          practices, and getting mentored by experienced developers. That’s like
          finding one of Willy Wonkas golden tickets!
          <br /><br />
          I know that I will put all my efforts in if you decide to give me this
          opportunity. I finally know within what field I want to build my
          career and now I just want to find a place for me where I can start
          doing this. I truly believe and hope that J-academy is my way to
          pursue this dream.
