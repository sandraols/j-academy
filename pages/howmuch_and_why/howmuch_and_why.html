          Ok, so I want to participate in the J-academy very much. Let’s just
          make that clear.<br><br>And why do I want that?
          <br><br>First of all it has been hard
          for me to find that first-time-job within web development. Either the
          job applications requirements are waaaay above my expertise or, if I
          am lucky enough to land an interview, the recruiters always get back
          to me saying “we really liked you but right now we are looking for
          someone with more experience. We will recruit again next year and
          encourage you to apply then.” Even when I say that I am open to do an
          internship until then it is apparently impossible because I am not
          “linked” to an education. So I am kind of caught in the middle here.
          And It. Is. Frustrating.<br><br>I truly believe that I need that career
          kickstart that are mentioned in the application form.<br><br>Second of all I want
          to participate because it seems that Jayway is a good and fun company,
          I like your values and it would be an honour to somewhat be a part of
          that for a couple of months. It seems like you have a very nice vibe
          going on and after stalking you on instagram for a while I feel like I
          would fit in. And the office in Malmö looks divine.<br><br> Third; I really
          would benefit from everything J-academy will provide, including
          working in a team, work on a real project, learn agile development
          practices, and get mentored by experienced developers. That is like
          finding one of Willy Wonkas golden tickets.<br><br> I know that I will put all
          my efforts in whatever project you will have if you decide to give me
          this opportunity. I finally know within what field I want to build my
          career and now I just want to find the place for me where I can start
          doing this. I believe and truly hope that J-academy is my way to
          pursue this dream.
